# Design Patterns

This project contains practical implementations of the most common and useful design patterns using the Java programming language.

## Overview

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. This repository demonstrates patterns categorized by the **Gang of Four (GoF)** into:

- **Creational Patterns**
- **Structural Patterns**
- **Behavioral Patterns**

Each pattern includes:
- A brief description
- Source code examples
- UML-style comments (when applicable)
- A simple client/demo to illustrate usage

## Creational Patterns

- [`Singleton`](./creational/singleton)  
  Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.

- [`Prototype`](./creational/prototype)  
  Creates object copies efficiently using a cloning interface/abstract class.

- [`Factory Method`](./creational/factorymethod)  
  Delegates object creation to subclasses through a common interface.

- [`Abstract Factory`](./creational/abstractfactory)  
  Provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

- [`Builder`](./creational/builder)  
  Separates complex object construction from its representation.
